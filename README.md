# Neuroevolution
This field started with fixed-topology networks (optimize weights only), moved to complexifying networks (TWEANN), and then began to focus on indirectly encoded networks (NEAT, CPPN, HyperNEAT). One other recent influential idea in the field is novelty search. Quality diversity algorithms (the next step beyond novelty search) add the notion of fitness back in, but in a careful way so as not to undermine the delicate push for novelty. Much research over the years and continuing to this day has focused on how to evolve plastic ANNs, which means networks with connection weights that change over the lifetime of the network.
